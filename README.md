## Projects

### Autonomous Vehicle Control
- **Description:** Developed navigation, adaptive cruise control, and obstacle avoidance algorithms in MATLAB. Deployed on Renault Zoe with Python and ROS, leading the autonomous stack that secured 1st place awards.
- **Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/theguega/decision-control-navigation)

### Embedded Drone Scripting Engine
- **Description:** Built a real-time embedded Lua engine in C++, reducing mission prototyping time by 4×. Integrated a local LLM in Rust for natural-language drone commands.
- **Link:** [View Details](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/defence-and-security/press_release/thales-demonstrates-its-capacity-deploy-drone-swarms)

### Brain-to-Text’25 (Kaggle Competition)
- **Description:** Designed and implemented a RNN with PyTorch to decode 256-channel neural spike trains into text. Built the training & evaluation pipeline with custom dataloaders, batching, and sequence-aware loss.

### Neural Surrogate for Model Predictive Control
- **Description:** Developed a neural surrogate for Model Predictive Control comparing different models (SVMs, MLPs, RNNs) to approximate optimal control policies. Benchmarked against reinforcement learning baselines, evaluating RMSE, tracking error, constraint violations, and learning curves to assess accuracy and real-time feasibility in robotics control.

### Peillute
- **Description:** Designed a distributed, cross-platform payment application in Rust. Implemented peer-to-peer communication inspired by “Pay'UTC” without relying on central servers.
- **Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/theguega/peillute)

### Real-Time Kernel (RTOS)
- **Description:** Implemented a preemptive RTOS from scratch on STM32 in C and Rust. Added mutexes, semaphores, and priority inversion handling for robust concurrency.
- **Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/theguega/bare-metal-dev)

### Teleoperated Robotic Arm
- **Description:** Developed a dual-arm robotic system achieving 80% task success at 50 Hz using pi-0 VLA. Applied reinforcement and imitation learning with PyTorch and HuggingFace for teleoperation.
- **Link:** [View Details](https://huggingface.co/lerobot)

### TurtleBot Maze Mapping
- **Description:** Created a maze exploration and mapping system in ROS. Enabled TurtleBot to autonomously navigate unknown environments using LiDAR, odometry, ultrasound, and camera sensors.
- **Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/theguega/ros-maze-mapping)

### VTOL and FPV Drone Coordination
- **Description:** Designed a multi-drone coordination system enabling autonomous following behavior. Supported MAVSDK and Parrot Olympe protocols for cross-platform deployment.
- **Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/theguega/drone-coordination)

### SmallGrad
- **Description:** An open source tiny ndarray-values autograd engine and a neural net library on top of it with PyTorch-like API.
- **Link:** [GitHub](https://github.com/theguega/smallgrad)
